# Word-Puzzle-Solver
 This Word Puzzle Solver, built as part of our DSA project for Semester 3, uses DFS, BFS, and Trie to search for words in a 2D grid. It explores the grid recursively (DFS) or layer by layer (BFS) and utilizes a Trie for efficient word lookups, solving word search puzzles and graph traversal tasks.
