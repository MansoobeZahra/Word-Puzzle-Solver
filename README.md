**# Word-Puzzle-Solver**

 This Word Puzzle Solver, built as part of our DSA project for Semester 3, uses DFS, BFS, and Trie to search for words in a 2D grid. It explores the grid recursively (DFS) or layer by layer (BFS) and utilizes a Trie for efficient word lookups, solving word search puzzles and graph traversal tasks.
** Overview**
This project is a Word Puzzle Solver implemented as part of our DSA project for Semester 3. The solver uses Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Trie data structure to search for words in a 2D grid of characters. The grid is treated as a graph, and words are searched both recursively and systematically using graph traversal techniques.

**Concepts Used**
 
**Graph using Adjacency Matrix:** Representing the grid as a graph, showing connections between neighboring cells.
**Depth First Search (DFS): **Implemented using a stack to explore possible word paths recursively.
**Breadth First Search (BFS): **Implemented using a queue to explore the grid level by level.
 
**Trie Data Structure:** Used for storing dictionary words, allowing efficient prefix-based search.
**Unordered Maps and Sets (Hashmaps):** Used in the Trie structure for fast insertion and searching of dictionary words.
****Time Taken****
Total Duration: 2 weeks
Week 1: Research and experimentation with algorithms.
Week 2: Design, coding, testing, debugging, and final implementation.
**Algorithms Used**
Depth First Search (DFS)
Takes the word to be searched.
Uses a stack and 2D array to mark visited cells.
Explores neighbors to find valid word paths.
Continues until the stack is empty.
Breadth First Search (BFS)
Takes the dictionary from the Trie.
Uses a queue and 2D array to mark visited cells
